Your quiz game code is well-structured but can benefit from several enhancements. 
First, ensure that you use `document.createElement('button')` instead of `document.createElement('answerbtn')` for button creation.
In the `showLeaderboard` function, check if `displayScores` is `null` to prevent errors, using a fallback for empty scores. 
Improve the timer logic to prevent it from going negative.
Additionally, streamline the `showQuestion` function by using a loop to dynamically create answer buttons, making the code cleaner.
When restarting the game in the `startAgain` function, remember to reset the timer and hide the leaderboard.
Lastly, consider adding basic error handling for localStorage operations to enhance overall robustness.
These changes will make your game more efficient and reliable.
